Project Objectives:

Sender Program:

Accepts two command-line arguments: the Process ID (PID) of the receiver program and the message to be sent.
Converts each character of the message into a series of bits and sends these bits to the receiver using 
signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).
Receiver Program:

Sets up signal handlers (sigaction()) to handle SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.
Listens for incoming signals that represent bits (0 or 1) of the characters being sent by the sender.
Reconstructs the bits into characters and displays the received message.
Communication Process:

Sender Program:

Converts characters into bits (0s and 1s).
Sends each bit to the receiver using signals (SIGUSR1 for '1' and SIGUSR2 for '0').
Sends a special sequence to indicate the end of a character (e.g., after 8 bits).
Receiver Program:

Sets up signal handlers for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
Waits for incoming signals.
Records bits based on the signals received.
Constructs characters from the received bits.
Prints the characters as they are received.
Detects the end of the message when a null character ('\0') is received.
The sender and receiver programs establish communication by exchanging signals representing bits of characters.
The receiver interprets these signals, reconstructs the bits into characters, and displays the received message.
