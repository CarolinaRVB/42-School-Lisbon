## About 42 School

42 School is a unique educational program that originated in France and has since expanded globally. It operates under a philosophy of peer-to-peer learning and project-based education, where students are encouraged to learn autonomously through practical, hands-on projects. One of the defining characteristics of 42 School is its lack of traditional teachers and classes. Instead, students collaborate, learn, and progress at their own pace, fostering a dynamic and innovative learning environment.
